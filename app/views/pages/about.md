About
=====

My name is Matt Chun-Lum. I'm a senior engineer and tech lead at [IMVU
Inc.](http://www.imvu.com/jobs) My undergraduate degree is in computer systems
engineering with a focus in mechatronics. Before I had a "real" job, I spent my
summers teaching computer science to kids. I still enjoy teaching, and I
recently started volunteering with [Hack the Future](http://hackthefuture.org).
