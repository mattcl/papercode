Random bits
===========

*-5/30/2013*

Like many other people, I am a huge fan of *Calvin and Hobbes*. When I was a
kid, I was fortunate enough that my parents would buy me the anthologies so that
I could read them whenever I felt like it. When I would happen accross a cartoon
that I thought was particularly funny, I'd write down the page number in a table
on the inside cover. Now, when I look through those books, it amuses me to see
the overlap between what I found funny then and what I find funny now. There is
quite a bit of overlap, though now that I have more "life" experience, I can
better appreciate the depth that some of the cartoons hold. My younger self
lacked this knowlege.

This collection of thoughts is my new inner cover. I hope to someday return to
what I have written here and evaluate how much I've grown (and hopefully I will
have changed for the better). I don't consider myself to be an expert in my
field, but I do consider myself to be opinionated about the "right" way to do
things. It will amuse me to look back on how my opinions change. Perhaps, if you
are not my future self, it will amuse you as well.
