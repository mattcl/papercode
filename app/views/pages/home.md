Like many other people, I am a huge fan of *Calvin and Hobbes*. When I was a
kid, I was fortunate enough that my parents would buy me the anthologies so that
I could read them whenever I felt like it. When I would happen across a cartoon
that I thought was particularly funny, I'd write down the page number in a table
on the inside cover. Now, when I look through those books, it amuses me to see
the overlap between what I found funny then and what I find funny now. There is
quite a bit of overlap, though now that I have more "life" experience, I can
better appreciate the depth that some of the cartoons hold. My younger self
lacked this knowledge.

This collection of thoughts is my new inside cover. I hope to someday return to
what I have written here and evaluate how much I've grown (and hopefully I will
have changed for the better). I don't consider myself to be an expert in my
field, but I do consider myself to be opinionated about the "right" way to do
things. It will amuse me to look back on how my opinions change.

I am also a fan of origami. I could get all philosophical and tell you about how
every fold matters, and how it's the journey, not the destination, but the truth
is that it's a cheap hobby, and I have too many expensive ones. Also, girls love
it, or so I'm told. I'll try to fold a different model for each post, if only to
serve as something worthwhile for you or my future self to look at if my
ramblings turn out to be indecipherable.
